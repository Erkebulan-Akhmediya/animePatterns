# Anime Patterns

### Description
My project is an anime website called “Anime Patterns”. In this website users can sign up and sign in. They will be able to enjoy their favorite shows and create list of favorite ones. Also, the website enables you to create list of anime that you are planning to watch. For the administration part, there is an admin panel that allows the admin to add new shows, update or delete existing ones and delete or update users signed on the website. MVC software architecture is going to be implemented as well as number of different software patterns. The back end of the project is written on TypeScript and NodeJS using Express framework. I used MongoDB for this project. For authorization I used JSON web tokens.
